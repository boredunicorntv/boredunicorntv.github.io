## Magical Realism

Magical realism is a genre of literature that depicts the real world as it really is,
having an undercurrent of magic or fantasy. Magical realism is a part of the realism
genre of fiction.

Within a work of magical realism, the world is grounded in the real world,
and fantastical elements are not ignored.

## Bored Unicorn TV

Magical realism has captued the hearts and imaginations of readers around the world.

## Venture Capital

We're currently not seeking investors or suddent injections of capital.
